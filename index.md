### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

  Lab 3, part 1. This lab was especially interesting because it showed me how mathematical formulas can be turned into real computer programs that help people. I enjoyed learning how to write functions that calculate different results for men and women using the same input values. The lab taught me practical programming skills while also helping me understand how computers can be used in health and fitness applications.

* Lab 5

  Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because it showed me how to turn complicated decimal numbers into simple measurements like feet and inches. I enjoyed learning how to make a program that helps people measure things for real projects like building furniture. This lab made me realize how programming can take confusing math problems and turn them into useful tools that everyone can understand.

* Lab 9

  Lab 9, part 2 was challenging but interesting because I learned how to make programs that could save and read secret information in files. Even though I had a hard time figuring out how to handle file errors and connect two programs together. Creating a game where players could actually hide numbers from each other made all the struggles worthwhile and helped me understand how programs can work with files.
